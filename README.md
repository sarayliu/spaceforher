This repo contains all the files from the src folder of the web app. 
App.js contains the content of the main page. 
MenuBar.js contains the content of the sidebar and incorporates the App.js content in.
Scattergram.js includes the code for the scattergram on the home page.
WriteaReview.js includes the code for the page where you can submit reviews for clubs.
index.js includes the main render command and some extra styling. The current page that is being run is from MenuBar. We were not able to get the WriteaReview page working
within our current index.js file. However, if the portion of the code that specificies MenuBar is replaced with WriteaReview, the WriteaReview page works.
